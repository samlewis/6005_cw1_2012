This project is a fork of the INFO6005 reference code which can be found at: https://github.com/info6005/6005_cw1_2012

This project consists of a command line tool which has been packaged to the Debian standard and has been checked to be clean by the Lintian tool.  

By default the tool gets the top 10 headlines from the BBC News website.  The user can specify the RSS feed and the number of items to fetch.  Please type "man cw1.6005.sl14g08" after installing the package for more information on this.

To install the package please navigate to the folder the package file is located and use the following command:
	sudo dpkg -i cw1.6005.sl14g08_1.1.deb

If you do not have the php5-cli package installed on your computer, an error warning will appear and the package will not work.  If you get an error message then enter the following at the command line:
	sudo apt-get -f install
Which will install the required dependencies for you.
